i wonder what differences are between [datasetA](/data/shakespeare/prepare.py) and [datasetB](/data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py)

in datasetB, it says

Prepare the Shakespeare dataset for **character-level language modeling**.
So instead of encoding with **GPT-2 BPE tokens**, we just *map characters to ints*.
Will save train.bin, val.bin containing the **ids**, and **meta.pkl** containing the **encoder and decoder** and some other related info.

# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) vs Character-level Language Modeling

It's difficult to say which encoding method is faster for training without more information about the specific training setup and the performance of the language model.

In general, character-level language models tend to be simpler and faster to train than models that use more complex encoding methods like BPE. However, BPE can be more effective at reducing the vocabulary size and improving the performance of the language model, which can ultimately lead to faster training times.

The specific choice of encoding method depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the language model, and the performance requirements of the application. It's important to experiment with different encoding methods and evaluate their performance on the specific task at hand to determine the most effective approach.
