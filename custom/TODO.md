since i only have a crappy laptop, i have installed the cutting edge Pytorch Nightly as suggested in [here](/README.md).

now, i want to see how it performs following the quick start guide.

# TODO: follow the quick start guide

- [x] run `$ python data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py`
  > the script separates the data into `train` set for training and `val` set for validation
  [x] i have to add dataset related files to `.gitignore` because it's disturbing to track them
